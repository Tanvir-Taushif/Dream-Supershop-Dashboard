# Dream Super Shop Sales Dashboard

This project is part of my **learning journey** as I transition into Data Analytics and Analytics Engineering. It is my first attempt at building an **interactive Excel dashboard** for analyzing sales data of "Dream Super Shop."

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Updates:** The dashboard leverages Power Query, allowing real-time updates when source data is modified or appended.  
- **Comprehensive Insights:**  
  - Sales performance and customer segmentation (e.g., premium vs. non-premium).  
  - Trends across months, age groups, and product categories.  
  - Top-selling products and customer occupation analysis.  
- **Interactive Visuals:** Fully responsive visuals powered by Pivot Tables and Excel charts.  

## Source Data

The data used in this project was **entirely self-generated** with the help of custom prompts in ChatGPT.

- Over **12,000 sales records**, 200 customers, and detailed product and category data were created to simulate real-world scenarios.  
- This dataset serves as a robust foundation for practicing data transformation and visualization techniques.
